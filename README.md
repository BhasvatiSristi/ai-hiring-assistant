# TalentScout – AI Hiring Assistant

## Project Overview  
TalentScout is an AI-powered hiring assistant designed to automate the initial screening of technology candidates. It collects candidate information, dynamically generates technical interview questions based on the candidate’s tech stack, and stores responses securely for recruiter review. The system uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate a real interview experience in a structured, context-aware way.

This project demonstrates prompt engineering, conversation state management, data handling, and LLM integration in a real-world hiring use case.

## Key Features  

- Conversational hiring assistant built with Streamlit  
- Collects candidate details (name, email, phone, role, location, experience, tech stack)  
- Validates email, phone number, and experience inputs  
- Dynamically generates technical interview questions using LLMs  
- One-by-one interview flow (real interviewer style)  
- Maintains conversation state using session memory  
- Securely stores candidate data locally in JSON format  
- GDPR-friendly data handling  
- Clean and intuitive UI

## Tech Stack  

- Python  
- Streamlit (Frontend UI)  
- OpenAI GPT (LLM)  
- JSON (Data storage)  
- python-dotenv (API key management)

## How It Works  

Candidate → Streamlit UI → Session State → LLM → Technical Questions → JSON Storage  

1. Candidate interacts with the chatbot via Streamlit UI  
2. Session state stores the conversation stage and candidate data  
3. When the tech stack is entered, the LLM generates tailored interview questions  
4. Questions are asked one-by-one to simulate a real interview  
5. Candidate data is stored in a local JSON file for recruiter review

## Prompt Engineering  

Two types of prompts are used:

System Role Prompt  
The LLM is instructed to act as a professional technical interviewer. It is guided to generate structured, relevant, and difficulty-appropriate questions.

Technical Question Prompt  
The model receives the candidate’s tech stack and is instructed to return 3–5 interview questions per technology in JSON format. This allows the system to ask questions one-by-one and maintain interview flow.

## Data Privacy & GDPR Compliance  

TalentScout follows GDPR principles:

- Only necessary hiring information is collected  
- Data is stored locally and not shared with third parties  
- No personal information is sent to the LLM  
- Candidates can request deletion of their data  
- Data is used strictly for recruitment demonstration purposes

## Installation  

1. Clone the repository  
```bash
git clone <https://github.com/BhasvatiSristi/ai-hiring-assistant>
cd TalentScout-AI
```

2. Create virtual environment  
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Add API key  
Create a `.env` file  
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
```

5. Run the app  
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Usage  

1. Start the Streamlit app  
2. Enter your personal and professional details  
3. Provide your tech stack  
4. Answer technical questions generated by the AI  
5. The interview concludes and data is saved to data/candidates.json

## Challenges & Solutions  

Managing conversation flow → Implemented a stage-based state machine  
LLM dumping all questions → Converted LLM output into a question queue  
Avoiding duplicate data → Added completion guards  
Privacy concerns → Stored data locally and avoided sending personal info to LLM
Preventing invalid inputs → Added email, phone, and numeric validation
